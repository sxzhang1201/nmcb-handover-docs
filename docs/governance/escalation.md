# Issue log and escalation

A hand-over is incomplete without a simple rule for what to do when a task fails.

## Escalation model

| Issue type | Example | First action | Escalate to |
|---|---|---|---|
| Access issue | Cannot open Castor or shared drive | Verify own permissions and recent changes | System owner / IT |
| Data integrity issue | Duplicate subject IDs | Pause downstream merging | Data manager |
| Participant workflow issue | Screener not sent in time | Record impacted participant(s) and fix if possible | Study coordinator |
| Device issue | Corrupt or missing VU-AMS export | Preserve raw files and document issue | Device owner / research team |
| Warehouse issue | Snowflake connection failure | Capture error and test access assumptions | Data engineer / IT |

## Minimum issue log fields

When tracking recurring issues, capture at least:

- date
- workflow
- summary of problem
- impact
- action taken
- owner
- status

## Principle

Do not silently work around structural issues. If a workaround becomes repeated behaviour, it should either be documented as the new process or escalated as a design problem.
